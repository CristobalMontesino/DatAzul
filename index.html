			<h1>experience</h1>
			<h2>about myself</h2>
			<p>
				Ever since graduation from TAFE in 2012, I volunteered at different organisations where I promoted and developed websites 
				for small and medium companies. With five years experience in web design and development, I have become more capable in HTML 
				and CSS along with common PHP, JS and CMS functionality regularly required for all business needs. This has demonstrated my 
				adaptability, flexibility and determination working in a fast paced environment with quickly changing needs. 
			</p>
			<h3>vision</h3>
			<p>
				I always carry out new ideas and combine them into something creative like a new piece of artwork. I love to help diverse people 
				where I can design amazing websites that are easy, wonderful and simple to understand. A positive mind is an absolute must when 
				working together as a team or managing a new task independently to assist businesses for high quality design and development. 
				Based on the user experience desired I can create the website from sketchbook through to final project.
